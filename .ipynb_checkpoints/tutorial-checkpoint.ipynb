    "## Problems addressed and motivation\n",
    "In class, we already discussed how inverse kinematics (IK) can be used to make a robot arm place its end effector at a desired position.  We learned an analytical approach to solving IK for a 2-arm robot in 2D.  We also learned how to use the MoveIt tool to run IK for more complicated arms in 3D.  However, after hours of trying to install MoveIt on my local Ubuntu virtual machine, including significant time with Prof. Stein's help, we gave up on installing it.  This disappointed me, since MoveIt would have opened up many creative possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "I love using engineering tools to create art; this was a large part of why I worked in STEM museum education for a few years.  So even without access to MoveIt, I chose to create a simulated robot arm which can \"paint\" points in 3D space at the location of its end effector.  This tool can create artistic and colorful point clouds in 3D space.  It also avoids collision with obstacles."

    "[Cyclic Coordinate Descent](https://motion.cs.illinois.edu/RoboticSystems/InverseKinematics.html#Cyclic-Coordinate-Descent) entails initializing all angles at arbitrary values, then visiting each angle one-by-one.  For each angle visited, that angle is set to whatever value would minimize the distance between the end effector and the goal, assuming all other angles are held constant.  This is repeated for some number of cycles until the end effector is sufficiently close to the goal.\n",

This is different from Cyclic Coordinate Descent in that it considers error in each dimension separately and also adjusts all angles simultaneously.  Joubert provides a useful figure highlighting how the Jacobian is iteratively descended:\n",

    "Collision avoidance is a key concern in real-world applications of robot arm IK.  An arm must avoid colliding with itself and with obstacles in its environment, some of which may be moving.  Furthermore, in situations where multiple arms are used nearby one another, they must avoid collisions with each other.  [Zhao et al](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10846-020-01279-w) published an approach for solving IK problems with multiple arms in environments where objects may be moving.  They build their work ground-up from Newtonian principles and first-order differential equations.\n",

In addition to using Jacobians as described previously, they also leveraged a potential field, which they claim is frequently seen in IK solutions for dynamic environments.\n",

    "## Technical details of my method\n",
    "I built a Cyclic Coordinate Descent (CCD) system for a four-segment arm.  Much like a construction crane, the arm's base angle $\\theta_0$ about the vertical axis, and its three other joints rotate about the line parallel to the ground.  The base angle $\\theta_0$ points in the $+x$ direction when set to 0, and increases in the counterclockwise direction when viewed from above.  The next angle $\\theta_1$ points horizontally when set to 0, and increases in the counterclockwise direction when viewed from the robot's right.  The remaining angles $\\theta_2, \\theta_3$ point in the same direction as the angle immediately before them when set to 0, and increase in the counterclockwise direction when viewed from the robot's left.  A single obstacle exists near the robot, in the form of a 2x2 rectangle aligned with the $y=1$ plane and centered on $(0, 1, 0)$.  Both forward and inverse kinematics are powered by matrix multiplications of affine transformations, as done in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system takes in a series of *goal points* to draw, as well as an optional color for each point.  The robot begins with all its angles set to 0.  For each goal point, it uses CCD (described in *Existing work*) to find angles that bring it \"closest\" to the goal.  To avoid collision, angles which would reuslt in a collision with an obstacle are not considered.  CCD is not an optimal approach, but as is discussed in the section *Performance metrics, results, discussion*, it does decently well.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, some visualization code I've written takes over.  Angles for a series of inbetween poses are found for each pair of consecutive steps, by taking graduated linear combinations of the new and old values per angle.  Then a `matplotlib` animation shows the robot moving from position to position.  In this animation, the inbetween poses serve to approximate how the arm might move.  However, they are for aesthetic purposes only, and do not guarantee collision avoidance.  That guarantee is only given in the goal frames, to which the inbetween frames are a less rigorous mesh."

    "## Performance metrics, results, discussion\n",
    "To determine how accurately the robot places its end effector, I generated four tests, in the form of three .txt files, each containing a series of points for it to draw.  These files are as follows:\n",

In this new test, I initialized the angles to $[\\pi/2, 0, 0, 2\\pi/3, \\pi/3]$, in that order.  These angles got the CCD algorithm \"unstuck\", and allowed it to reach a much better accuracy and standard deviation."

    "I showed that assistive initialization can help overcome a stalled CCD process.  This project could be improved by automating assistive initialization, such as by starting the arm pointing directly toward the goal, with all segments straight, and then gradually adjusting the angles so that the end effector stays still but the arm pushes itself away from the center of the obstacle.\n",
