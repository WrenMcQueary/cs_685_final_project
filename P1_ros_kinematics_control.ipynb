    "This is the first programming assignment you will be asked to complete in the course. You are *highly recommended* to LaTeX your solutions to this assignment and use the 10pt, 2-column `ieeeconf` template. You can find the template [on Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/preparation-of-papers-for-ieee-sponsored-conferences-and-symposia/zfnqfzzzxghk); Overleaf is an online LaTeX editor with a free tier, so feel free to use that service to compose your writeups. It is perhaps the easiest option, particularly if you are not as familiar with LaTeX. While there is no space limit, please try to keep your plots compact so that they do not consume an enormous amount of space; mostly this helps readability (and therefore grading). You are allowed to work in small groups (2 or 3 students), but your solutions and your writeup should be your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these homework assignments, I expect that your solutions will be written as if they are research papers: though the content is not \"new\", you should be trying to convince me through your writing that you have implemented and understand the algorithms. You should write in full sentences. When appropriate, comment on when the algorithms succeed or fail and where they are more or less effective; include numbers/metrics (quantitative) in addition to discussion (qualitative) whenever possible. Just like in a published paper, you should not include code snippets in your writeup unless it is explicitly asked for or you think it helps you explain your results or answer the question. **I will ask you to submit both the PDF of your writeup *and* a .zip file containing your code (which may be a modified form of this Jupyter notebook) on Blackboard. Unless asked, do not include code in your writeup. You should present your results well enough that I trust your implementation was sufficient.** Though it would be nice if your code were cleaned up and nicely formatted/commented, we will are only likely to run your code to evaluate partial credit or unless we are skeptical for academic integrity reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are welcome to work in small groups of 2 or 3 students, but please write your solutions independently: I would like your answers to the more conceptual questions to be in your own words, even if you discussed the answers with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be graded on your included plots and answers to conceptual questions. Your code will not be directly graded or evaluated. You can receive partial credit on pretty much everything, and I try to be a fair as possible: giving you a grade that I think reflects your level of understanding of the material. Note that while I appreciate you submitting plots that you *know* are probably not quite right, it can be hard for me to evaluate partial credit if things are not quite working; in this case, try to include in your response a guess of where you think your solution didn't work. This will help me know when to give you more credit on your responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: While additional text is appreciated and can help with partial credit, you are only being directly evaluated on the things I ask for. You do not need to write paragraphs of text describing your images. I don't want you to feel like you have to write unless I specifically ask for it."

You should install ROS 1, not ROS 2. Another version *could* work, but ROS is not known for its cross-version compatability and I expect you will struggle at some point in the class if you have a nontrivial version difference.**\n",

    "Concepts: experimenting with ROS fundamentals; ensuring ROS is properly installed.\n",

    "1. https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage This will tell you how to create a ROS package. The tutorial looks long, but it's mostly a lot of explanation. You only need to follow steps 1–4, which involves first creating a workspace (something like `mkdir -p ~/cs685_ws/src && cd ~/cs685_ws/src`), creating a package in that workspace (`catkin_create_pkg beginner_tutorials std_msgs rospy roscpp`), and then building it (via `catkin_make`).\n",

    "\n",
    "**TASK** Create a *launch file*. Make a new `launch` directory in your package (the `beginner_tutorials` package) and add a launch file `l01.launch` to it. Fill that file with the following:\n",

    "**QUESTION** On another terminal, you can run `rostopic list` to get the channels that you're printing to. There should now be two topics with \"chatter\" in the name.

    "\n",
    "**IMAGES** For both of those new \"chatter\" topics, run `rostopic hz TOPIC_NAME` and take a screenshot of the outputs. This will show you the rate at which messages are being published to the topic and should match your intuition.\n",

    "1. Subscribes to both topics (one function for each topic).\n",
    "2. Upon receiving the \"slow\" messages, the class both publishes a message and prints out a log message to the command line. The message should contain (1) the name of your new node and (2) both previous messages (concatenated together, since they are just strings).\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, the callback function for the fast listener should store the message string to the class. The callback function for the slow listener should get the string from its message and combine it with the stored string from the fast message.\n",
